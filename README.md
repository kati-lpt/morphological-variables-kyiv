# Morphological Variables calculation in Kyiv, Ukraine

This study investigates the relationship, differences, and similarities between the urban design of modern residential housing complexes and Soviet-era microrayon residential complexes in the capital city of Kyiv, Ukraine. The research questions animating this study are: Have todayâ€™s residential complexes in Kyiv, and by extension elsewhere in Ukraine, inherited design approaches of the Soviet planning system, or have they instead embraced other, more contemporary urban design principles? We are additionally interested in answers to the following questions:  What are the morphological differences and similarities in the design of the selected housing projects from both eras? To what extent do post-independence residential complexes represent a succession or deviation from the design of Soviet-era microrayons? What is achieved by any differences between the typologies, and why do these differences exist?

In this repository, you can find SQL files and Geopandas files that we used to calculate the research parameters for the comparison. SQL scripts we ran in QGIS as Virtual Layers. Geopandas files we ran through VS Code and Python.
